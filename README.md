# emailApp.js
This is a simple app I originally created to learn the very basics of AngularJS (there aren't any partial views in this one, although will probably refactor at a later date to use them or refactor completely to Angular2).  

It uses bootstrap for the modal pop up utility, and basic data structures (stack, etc.) to manage email addition, with all of this managed under Angular's built in directives.  I designed the UI to have a similar feel to a very familiar email system :-)
